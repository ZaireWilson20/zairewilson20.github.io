&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main concepts I wanted to focus on for Grocery Run is making the player feel a sense of anxiety and fear through gameplay. This felt particularly important considering the grocery store setting doesn't really instill the same type of creepiness that you'll get from the dark, empty forest in [Slenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Be7v_9qD8&ab_channel=Markiplier){:target="_blank"} or the dilapidated underwater city of [Rapture in Bioshock 1 + 2](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-genius-of-rapture){:target="_blank"}. The fear/anxiety a person feels when dealing with a Karen isn't really based on the environment, but moreso around the fact that you're being watched and that any move you make could be interpretted in a way that could cause you trouble. With this in mind, I decided that if I can't change **what** the player sees, I'll control **how** they perceive what's around them by manipulating the **Camera Perspective** and **Camera Control**. 
<br>
<br>

<h2>Camera Perspective</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing research for this game, I noticed a huge part of what makes horror games effective at giving the player the heeby jeebies are the perspectives the player is given. When moving through doors and other transitional walkways in the OG Resident Evil, the camera would fade to black while bringing and isolated view of the passageway (doors, stairs, etc) into the player's view; this created a anxious sense of anticipation as the player is made aware that they'll be something new, but is given no visual heads up into what might await on the other side of the door. Basically, the player doesn't know what's around the corner until they are looking directly at it. While Resident Evil was made in 3rd person, we can use different techniques within the 1st person perspective to take away visual information from the player in hopes of inducing anxiety an paranoia.
