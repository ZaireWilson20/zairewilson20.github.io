&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main concepts I wanted to focus on for Grocery Run is making the player feel a sense of anxiety and fear through gameplay. This felt particularly important considering the grocery store setting doesn't really instill the same type of creepiness that you'll get from the dark, empty forest in [Slenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Be7v_9qD8&ab_channel=Markiplier){:target="_blank"} or the dilapidated underwater city of [Rapture in Bioshock 1 + 2](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-genius-of-rapture){:target="_blank"}. The fear/anxiety a person feels when dealing with a Karen isn't really based on the environment, but moreso around the fact that you're being watched and that any move you make could be interpretted in a way that could cause you trouble. With this in mind, I decided that if I can't change **what** the player sees, I'll control **how** they perceive what's around them by manipulating the **Camera Perspective** and **Camera Control**.
